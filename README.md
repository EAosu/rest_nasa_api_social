<h1> Welcome to Ex5 </h1>
<h5> Brought to you by: <br> Nadav Malul 206762973 <br> Ely Asaf 319027355 </h5>
<p> In this assignment we display the use of REST API. </p>
<p> All dynamic content is built directly from the js. </p> 
<p> Using bootstrap, we tried creating a responsive and clean display for the user. </p>
<p> Each Image displayed by nasa will be displayed in a row, each of the rows will be divided into three columns. 
<br>The first column will display the media (image/url) provided by NASA. <br>
The second column will show the description of the media (also provided by NASA). <br>
The third column will display the user's comments on a picture, and will also contain a real-time display of the server's response to adding a message,
deleting a message and more. </p>
<p> In smaller screens (large at most) each of these columns will function as a row, for a more convenient display. </p>
<p> As for styling, we mainly used bootstrap colors for background and opacity settings but also added a bit css when needed. </p>
<p> Also, we both would like to use a 1-day late submission approval (out of the 3 days each of us currently has). </p>
<h5> We hope you will enjoy our styling and our code. </h5>
